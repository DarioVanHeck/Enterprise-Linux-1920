# Enterprise Linux Lab Report - Troubleshooting

- Student name: Olivier Troch
- Class/group: TIN-TI-3B (Gent)

## Instructions

- Write a detailed report in the "Report" section below (in Dutch or English)
- Use correct Markdown! Use fenced code blocks for commands and their output, terminal transcripts, ...
- The different phases in the bottom-up troubleshooting process are described in their own subsections (heading of level 3, i.e. starting with `###`) with the name of the phase as title.
- Every step is described in detail:
    - describe what is being tested
    - give the command, including options and arguments, needed to execute the test, or the absolute path to the configuration file to be verified
    - give the expected output of the command or content of the configuration file (only the relevant parts are sufficient!)
    - if the actual output is different from the one expected, explain the cause and describe how you fixed this by giving the exact commands or necessary changes to configuration files
- In the section "End result", describe the final state of the service:
    - copy/paste a transcript of running the acceptance tests
    - describe the result of accessing the service from the host system
    - describe any error messages that still remain
